# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I believe that it's never too late to learn something new, and on my blog "Old Coder, New Tricks?", I will be sharing my journey of learning new programming concepts and techniques. As 		 I learn, I will be focused on sharing coding examples and solutions to various programming problems that I've encountered. My hope is that my blog will be a helpful resource for other programmers looking to expand their knowledge and learn new skills.
